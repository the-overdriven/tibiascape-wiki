- MP Regen: +0.01
- 0.01/s MP Regen = 1 MP per 100 seconds, 0.1/s MP Regen = 1 MP per 10 seconds, 1/s MP Regen = 1 MP per second

## What do you gain with level up apart from mastery points?
- only 0.5 in speed
- and full regen :)

## What to invest my points in?
- whatever you feel like, but skip hp regen, mp regen is better (exura costs 25 mp and heals min. 25 HP even with mlvl 1)

## How does regen work?
- you have your base vocational regen (active only if you eat food) 
- you also have regen based on your hp/mp regen attributes, one mastery point gives 1 mp per 100 sec (doesn't require food)

## Do you need to pick up spears, or do they break?
- no need to pick up, but they break

## Any beginner tips? (things you've wished to know sooner)
1. killing 100x of each monster is an easy way to level up because it gives you XP reward (but only once per monster)
2. you don't need level 2 to cross north Rook bridge and you don't need pacc for the west premium area
3. you don't loose any items in Rook when you die
4. NPC Lee'delle has the cheapest prices on Rook: axe 18gp, scythe 10gp, shovel 9gp, rope 45gp
5. NPC Hyacinth sells small health potions for 20gp
6. mage guilds sell health potions for 45-50gp (much better than life fluids from 7.6)
7. you don't need to have the gold on you to buy things (there is bank)
8. you don't need to write city when you send parcel (mailbox is global, but depots are local)
9. you can set a hotkey for attacking monsters with a spacebar (or any key) in client options
10. monsters have resistances similarily like in modern tibia (i.e. you can't SD banshee)
11. regardless of your PvP settings you can be killed without a frag by any player if you afk (door+field), or with a trap if you're PvP enabled
12. be aware that some quests give different rewards than normally (i.e. valuables or runes instead EQ)
13. have fun, don't forget it's just a game
