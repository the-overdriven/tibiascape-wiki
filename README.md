## any beginner tips? (things you've wished to know sooner)
1. killing 100x of each monster gives you xp (but only one time)
2. you don't need level 2 to cross Rook bridge and pacc for pacc side
3. you don't loose anything in Rook when you die
4. NPC Lee'delle has cheapest prices on Rook: axe 18gp, scythe 10gp, shovel 9gp, rope 45gp
5. NPC Hyacinth sells small health potions for 20gp
6. mage guilds sell health potions for 45-50gp (much better than life fluids from 7.6)
7. you don't need to have the gold on you to buy things (there is bank)
8. you don't need to write city when you send parcel (mailbox is global, but depots are local)
9. you can set a hotkey for attacking monsters with a spacebar (or any key) in client options
10. monsters have resistances similarily like in real tibia (i.e. you can't SD banshee)
11. regardless of your PvP settings you can be killed without a frag by any player if you afk (door+field), or with a trap if you're PvP enabled
12. be aware that some quests give different rewards than normally
