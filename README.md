- no, better think twice before spending them

## What is the attribute increase per one mastery point?
- HP: +2
- Mana: +2
- Capacity: +5
- HP Regen: +0.01 (skip, it's a useless attribute)
- MP Regen: +0.01
(0.01/s MP Regen = 1 MP per 100 seconds, 0.1/s MP Regen = 1 MP per 10 seconds, 1/s MP Regen = 1 MP per second)
- Speed: +0.2

## What do you gain with level up apart from mastery points?
- only 0.5 in speed
- and full regen :)

## What to invest my points in?
- whatever you feel like, but skip hp regen, mp regen is better (exura costs 25 mp and even on low mlvl heals around 25 HP and better mp regen boosts your mlvl in the long run)

## How does regen work?
- you have your base vocational regen (active only if you eat food) 
- you also have regen based on your hp/mp regen attributes, one mastery point gives 1 mp per 100 sec (doesn't require food)

## Do you need to pick up spears, or do they break?
- no need to pick up, but they break

## I've fished a Northern Pike, what is it for?
- Rashid quest (20 northern pikes are needed for Thursday mission)

## How to start Rashid quest?
- you start on Monday and have to do something for him every day for seven days
- if you skipped one day you don't have to start all over again on Monday, but you have to wait for the next weekday you've skipped

## Any beginner tips? (things you've wished to know sooner)
1. killing 100x of each monster is an easy way to level up because it gives you XP reward (but only once per monster and you don't get XP reward for 100 rats)
2. you don't need level 2 to cross north Rook bridge and you don't need pacc for the west premium area
3. you don't loose any items in Rook when you die
4. NPC Lee'delle has the cheapest prices on Rook: axe 18gp, scythe 10gp, shovel 9gp, rope 45gp
5. NPC Hyacinth sells small health potions for 20gp
6. mage guilds sell health potions for 45-50gp (much better than life fluids from 7.6)
7. you don't need to have the gold on you to buy things (there is bank)
8. you don't need to write city when you send parcel (mailbox is global, but depots are local)
9. you can set a hotkey for attacking monsters with a spacebar (or any key) in client options
10. monsters have resistances similarily like in modern tibia (i.e. you can't SD banshee)
11. if you're PvP you can be killed without a frag by any player if you afk (door+field), or with a trap
12. be aware that some quests give different rewards than normally (i.e. valuables or runes instead EQ)
13. be aware of luring and overspawn feature (if monster leaves its spawn it will not disappear and another one will spawn again, even if the first one was not killed)
14. have fun, don't forget it's just a game
